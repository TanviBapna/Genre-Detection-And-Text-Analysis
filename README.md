# Genre-Detection-And-Text-Analysis
 In this group project, we analysed text descriptions of movies and developed a predictive model that can predict whether or not a movie is a comedy. The descriptions/story were used to create textual features of the movie descriptions/story and multiple models were created in order to find the best performing model.
